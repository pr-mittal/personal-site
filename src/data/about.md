# Intro
 
I am a B.TECH. student at [IIT(BHU), Varanasi](https://iitbhu.ac.in/) with an interest in hardware design and its application. I am passionate about engineering and want to expand my technical skills and apply them to real-world applications. I have worked on projects involving **computer architecture**, **RTL models**, and **UVM** which intrigue me as it is the crucial part of building chips that enables the working of all the devices present around us. I am particularly interested in projects with high social impact. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause and would like to meet, please feel free to get in touch.

During my internship at NVIDIA, I gained valuable experience in writing performance tests for the memory system architecture. Additionally, I implemented scripts to monitor synthesis metrics and incorporated assertions for FIFO full tests. My projects have spanned various areas, including computer architecture, compiler design and robotics. In particular, I successfully designed a versatile RISC-based processor in Verilog capable of executing arithmetic and branch operations. 

Furthermore, I took on the challenge of developing a compiler for a Java-like high-level language, enabling the conversion of bytecode to machine-specific code. This project provided me with a profound understanding of the interplay between software and hardware. I possess proficient coding skills in **C++**, **Python**, and **Verilog**, enabling me to tackle complex challenges and contribute effectively to project development. I have gained valuable experience in verifying VHDL/Verilog-based digital hardware design blocks. I have proficiently utilised system Verilog and Python-based test benches, both on simulators and hardware boards, to ensure accurate validation. I am adept at writing comprehensive test cases and test benches, collaborating within small teams, I have taken ownership of end-to-end solutions and consistently sought ways to enhance productivity and improve verification processes.

# Some history

- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 2014 when I was 12. My favourite games were Project IGI , Rise of Nations , Road Rash and Gta Vice City . I also built diy planes , electric system and I believe that is where I receive my passion for engineering from !!

- My childhood's summer were the best . They usually consisted of tinkering some stuff , art or music classes or exploring a new sport. 

- I remember watching an onion cell under a microscope . It was so fascinating to observe the the smallest unit that can live on its own and that makes up all living organisms and the tissues of the body.

- I took science after high school . I will try and sum up my experience , I was good at chemistry as it was basically rules about how the properties of chemical affect their behaviour . Mathematics , introduced me to soo many new concepts such as vectors , Probabilty and Calculus , which built an algorthmic understang of approach a problem but it was physics that excited me the most where I spent most of my time. Electrostatics and Rotation which taught me the natural science of matter, involving the study of matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force.

- In college , I have been active in robotics ( Control Systems Team , Image Processing , ROS , IOT and Embedded Systems ) and aero modelling club ( built a drone and rc- plane ) . I also participated in electronics events which helped me to familiarise myself with Verilog Coding , MATLAB etc which provided me a great deal of technical exposure.

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
